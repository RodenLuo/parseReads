# parseReads

## Purpose
parseReads is designed to parse genome sequencing data to retrieve specific patterns. It works through reading in specific regular expression patterns and match this pattern with every read of the sequencing data, and retrieving the read that contains the pattern.

## output
The output of parseReads script is the count information for every species identified by the regular expression pattern, sorted from high to low
